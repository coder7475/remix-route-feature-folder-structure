# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.

### Manual Route Configuration

While theÂ `app/routes`Â folder offers a convenient convention for developers, Remix appreciates thatÂ [one size doesn't fit all](https://remix.run/docs/ja/main/file-conventions/routes#disclaimer). There are times when the provided convention might not align with specific project requirements or a developer's preferences. In such cases, Remix allows for manual route configuration viaÂ [`vite.config.ts`](https://remix.run/docs/ja/main/file-conventions/vite-config#routes). This flexibility ensures developers can structure their application in a way that makes sense for their project.

If you have not yet migrated toÂ [Vite](https://remix.run/docs/ja/main/guides/vite)Â and are still using theÂ [Classic Remix Compiler](https://remix.run/docs/ja/main/guides/vite#classic-remix-compiler-vs-remix-vite), you can configure routes manually in yourÂ [`remix.config.js`](https://remix.run/docs/ja/main/file-conventions/remix-config)Â file.

A common way to structure an app is by top-level features folders. Consider that routes related to a particular theme, like concerts, likely share several modules. Organizing them under a single folder makes sense:

```text
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ concerts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ city.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favorites-cookie.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sponsored.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trending.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ home/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.tsx
â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
```

To configure this structure into the same URLs as the previous examples, you can use theÂ `routes`Â function inÂ `vite.config.ts`:

```
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      routes(defineRoutes) {
        return defineRoutes((route) => {
          route("/", "home/route.tsx", { index: true });
          route("about", "about/route.tsx");
          route("concerts", "concerts/layout.tsx", () => {
            route("", "concerts/home.tsx", { index: true });
            route("trending", "concerts/trending.tsx");
            route(":city", "concerts/city.tsx");
          });
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Remix's route configuration approach blends convention with flexibility. You can use theÂ `app/routes`Â folder for an easy, organized way to set up your routes. If you want more control, dislike the file names, or have unique needs, there'sÂ `vite.config.ts`. It is expected that many apps forgo the routes folder convention in favor ofÂ `vite.config.ts`.
